# Oregon Birding App

*Note that this project is still very much in progress, and only currently has basic functionality. Soon there will be more features, along with details on how to install/use.*

This application is meant to provide several functions for showing/visualizing personal ebird data (via eBird cvs data download) that are not available in eBird. See below for examples. 
This app provides a simple UI to select different functions and provide data related to specific counties (or entire state), years, and birds in the state of Oregon. 

## Functions

Printing basic list

Displaying high counts for each species in a specific location

### Coming soon

Possibly quick sorting options
